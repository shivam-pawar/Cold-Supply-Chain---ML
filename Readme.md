<h1>About the project</h1>
Cold chain is a significant part in interfacing the customers and providers, it ensures that the production network of freezing and frozen food is in great characteristics.

The requirement for food is a preoccupation on that human share with all other species, it is one of the worries that lie at the centre of all the presence. The project will grow new creative displaying instruments that join nourishment quality and prediction time to consume food products like milk, meat, fish, etc. For this purpose, a machine learning algorithm is used with hardware support of RaspberryPi embedded with temperature sensor which will detect room temperature with particular timespan and machine learning algorithm predict the lifetime of food.
